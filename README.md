# Lead Scoring Case Study

### Problem:
X Education is and education company who sells online courses to industry professionals. They acquires leads through marketing campaign on several websites and past referrals, then sale team will contact leads by making calls, writing email, etc. Problem is that the conversion rate of this process is very poor (around 30%). The company wants to make the process more efficient by identifying the most potential leads (hot leads) to focus more on communicating. The CEO wants the lead conversion rate to be around 80%.

### Business Goal:
Using lead dataset provided by X Education Company, build a logistic regression model to predict hot leads by assigning a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.

### Results Included:
* Jupyter notebook with EDA, logistic regression model, the conversion predictions and evaluation metrics.
* The document of answers for all subjective questions.
* The overall approach of the analysis in a presentation.
* Summary report in 500 words explaining how you proceeded with the assignment and the learnings that you gathered.
